# Pass By Value vs Pass By Reference¬†

## üìò Overview

This documentation provides a comprehensive understanding of how **Java handles argument passing** ‚Äî specifically, how it treats **primitive types** and **object references** in method calls.

Java is strictly **pass-by-value**, but the behavior can be misunderstood, especially when dealing with object references. This task illustrates:

1. Pass-by-value for **primitives**
2. Pass-by-value for **object references** (modification of fields)
3. Pass-by-value with **reassignment** of object references

## üîç Definitions & Concepts

### üßÆ Primitive Types

Primitive types are the most basic data types in Java. They hold actual values rather than references. Java provides 8 primitive types:

* `int`
* `double`
* `float`
* `long`
* `short`
* `byte`
* `char`
* `boolean`

> üìå Example:

```java
double price = 200.0;  // This directly stores the value 200.0
```

### üß± Object References

In Java, an object reference is a variable that holds the **memory address** (or pointer) of an object, not the object itself. When you pass an object to a method, you're passing a **copy of the reference**.

> üìå Example:

```java
Product product = new Product("Phone", 500.0);
```

Here, `product` stores a reference (address) pointing to the actual `Product` object in memory.

### üì§ Pass-by-Value (Java's Approach)

Java always uses **pass-by-value**, meaning:

* For primitives, the **actual value** is copied.
* For objects, the **reference (address)** is copied, not the object.

This means that inside a method:

* You can change the contents of the object (fields), and it reflects outside.
* But reassigning a new object to the parameter only changes the local copy of the reference.

## üß† Concepts Illustrated

### 1. Primitive Types Are Passed by Value

When you pass a primitive (e.g., `int`, `double`) to a method, the value is copied. Changes inside the method **do not** affect the original.

```java
void updatePrice(double price) {
    price += 50;
}

```

### 2. Object References Are Also Passed by Value

The **reference (pointer)** to the object is copied. Thus, the method can modify the original object‚Äôs **fields**, and these changes will persist.

```java
void updateProduct(Product p) {
    p.setProductName("Updated");
    p.setPrice(999.99);
}
```

### 3. Reassigning Object References Does Not Persist

When you reassign a new object to the parameter inside the method, it only changes the **local copy** of the reference. The original reference remains unchanged.

```java
void reassignProduct(Product p) {
    p = new Product("New", 100.0);
}
```

## üß™ Use Case Output

Command:

```bash
java -cp out  PassByValueReferenceDemo
```

### ‚úÖ Output

```
Before updatePrice(): price = 200.0
Inside updatePrice() before update: price = 200.0
Inside updatePrice() after update: price = 250.0
After updatePrice(): price = 200.0
------------------------------------------
Before updateProduct(): Product {name='Original Product', price=500.00}
Inside updateProduct() before update: Product {name='Original Product', price=500.00}
Inside updateProduct() after update: Product {name='Updated Product', price=600.00}
After updateProduct(): Product {name='Updated Product', price=600.00}
------------------------------------------
Before reassignProduct(): Product {name='Updated Product', price=600.00}
Inside reassignProduct() before reassignment: Product {name='Updated Product', price=600.00}
Inside reassignProduct() after reassignment: Product {name='New Product', price=999.99}
After reassignProduct(): Product {name='Updated Product', price=600.00}
------------------------------------------
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Use Cases & Practical Scenarios

### üîß When working with primitives:

* Safe to pass into methods that calculate values without affecting the original.
* Use when you want **pure functions** that do not mutate external state.

### üß© When working with object references:

* Useful for **modifying** object fields, like setting user details, updating product prices, etc.
* Be cautious ‚Äî unintentional modifications can lead to **side effects**.

### üß® Reassigning object references:

* Cannot be used to change the caller's reference.
* Use this pattern to demonstrate **local-only effects** or prototype designs.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

* **Mistaking pass-by-reference**: Java doesn‚Äôt pass objects by reference; it passes **a copy of the reference by value**.
* **Unexpected mutations**: Modifying object fields in a method affects the caller‚Äôs object.

---

## üß≠ Conclusion

Java always uses **pass-by-value** semantics:

* For primitives, it‚Äôs a copy of the value.
* For objects, it‚Äôs a copy of the reference ‚Äî not the object itself.

Understanding this behavior is vital when debugging or architecting your Java applications to avoid surprises.

## üìå Tips

* Prefer **immutable objects** if you want to avoid side effects.
* Use clear naming and comments to indicate whether a method **mutates** or **just reads** an object.
