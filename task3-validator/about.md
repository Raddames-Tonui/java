This task primarily tests your understanding and practical skills in several key Java concepts, especially those relevant to Java runtime configuration, argument handling, XML validation, and packaging:

Core Java Concepts Tested:

JVM Options & Runtime Configuration

Understanding how to pass and use JVM command-line options like:

-Duser.timezone (Timezone setting)

-Xms (Minimum heap size)

-Xmx (Maximum heap size)

How JVM options influence runtime behavior.

Date and Time API

Using Java's Date/Time API (e.g., java.time package) to print current date and time according to the configured timezone.

Command-Line Arguments Parsing

Handling command-line arguments (-xml and -xsd) passed to the main method.

Implementing robust parsing logic that:

Recognizes expected flags and values.

Handles missing or invalid arguments gracefully (e.g., error messages or fallback logic).

XML Validation

Using Java XML APIs (like javax.xml.validation with SchemaFactory and Validator) to:

Load and validate an XML file against an XSD schema.

Detect and report validation errors or confirm validity.

Exception Handling

Proper use of try-catch blocks to manage:

File I/O errors (missing files, unreadable files).

XML parsing and validation exceptions.

Argument-related errors.

Graceful error reporting.

Packaging & Execution

Compiling Java classes and creating a runnable JAR file (java -jar my\_application.jar).

Defining a manifest with the Main-Class entry to allow execution from the command line.

Summary

This task evaluates your ability to combine Java runtime tuning (JVM options) with application logic that processes command-line inputs, integrates Java APIs for date/time and XML validation, and produces a self-contained executable artifact.

It demonstrates practical knowledge in:

JVM tuning,

CLI argument parsing,

working with XML/XSD validation,

exception handling,

and Java build & deployment processes.This task primarily tests your understanding and practical skills in several key Java concepts, especially those relevant to Java runtime configuration, argument handling, XML validation, and packaging:
