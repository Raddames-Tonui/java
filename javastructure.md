🧭 Strategy: Master Java Concepts Step-by-Step (Without Drowning)
🎯 1. Focus on Real-Use Tasks
You’re already doing this with task8_maps. Build real use-cases like:

Managing data with Map

Performing CRUD with objects

Sorting/filtering using streams

Handling nulls with Optional

📌 Each task you build is a lesson. Don't read Java docs endlessly—build and learn.

🧱 2. Group Concepts by Usage Area
Area	Learn These Concepts First
Collections	List, Map, Set, HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedList, computeIfAbsent()
Streams	filter(), map(), collect(), sorted(), Comparator
Null Handling	Optional, orElse(), isPresent(), ifPresent()
OOP Design	Classes, Inheritance, Constructors, Encapsulation (getters/setters)
Error Handling	try-catch, custom exceptions
Java 8+ Functional	Lambdas, method references, Predicate, Function
Files / Persistence	FileReader, BufferedReader, or later JDBC for DB

🧠 3. Daily Drill Plan (45–60 min/day)
Day	Focus
Mon	Collections → Play with List, Map, Set, nested maps
Tue	Stream API → Practice filter, map, sorted, groupingBy
Wed	Optional, computeIfAbsent, merge, getOrDefault
Thu	OOP Design → Build mini apps with classes, inheritance
Fri	Exception handling, validations
Sat/Sun	Apply everything in a mini-project like task8_maps

🛠️ 4. Use Your Projects As a Playground
Take one small feature, like “search employee by ID,” and explore:

How to use Optional there?

Can I do filtering with .stream() instead of a loop?

What if the department is missing? Use computeIfAbsent()?

You learn 10x faster when solving a real problem with the tool.

🔁 5. Repetition with Variation
Don’t fear forgetting. Instead:

Rebuild similar apps (students, products, books) using the same core logic.

E.g., CRUD for Products, then switch to Students, then to Books.

This builds muscle memory.

🧱 6. Keep a Concept Journal
After each concept (like Optional), write:

What is it?

When to use it?

One line of example

You’ll have your Java cheat sheet in a week.

✅ Summary: How to Learn Java Concepts Efficiently
Group them by usage, not Java class name.

Tie them to real-world tasks (like your map/employee logic).

Practice daily with small focused goals.

Apply them in multiple mini-projects (e.g., your task8_maps).

Write your own cheat sheet as you go.
